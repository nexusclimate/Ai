## Adding Content

### Add a Collection

Create a JSON file in `content/collections/`:

```json
{
  "slug": "collection-name",
  "title": "Collection Title",
  "description": "Collection description",
  "status": "active",
  "featured": true
}
```

### Add a Tool

Create a Markdown file in `content/tools/` with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Tool Name
slug: tool-slug
platform: OpenAI
url: https://example.com
collections:
  - collection-slug
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
maturity: beta  # beta, stable, or experimental
verified: true
featured: true
short_summary: "Brief tool description"
last_verified: "2026-02-11"  # Use quotes to avoid YAML date parsing
use_cases:
  - "Use case 1"
  - "Use case 2"
limitations:
  - "Limitation 1"
---

## What it does
Tool description in markdown format.

## Who it's for
Target audience description.
```

**Important:** Always quote the `last_verified` date to prevent YAML from parsing it as a Date object.

### Add a tool and sync to Updates (don’t forget)

When you add or update tools, the **Updates** page and **Recently updated** list should stay in sync.

**Recommended: one command after adding cards**

1. **Add your tool cards** — Create (or edit) Markdown file(s) in `content/tools/` and set `last_verified: "YYYY-MM-DD"` (e.g. today’s date).
2. **Run the release command** — This syncs tools to Updates and bumps the patch version by +0.0.1:
   ```bash
   npm run release:additions
   ```
   This will:
   - Sync new tools into `content/updates/YYYY-MM-DD-additions.md` (so they appear on the [Updates](/updates) page)
   - Bump the version in `package.json` (e.g. 1.1.12 → 1.1.13)

Then run `npm run build` when you’re ready to build with the new version.

**Optional:** Sync only (no version bump):
```bash
npm run update:sync
```
To sync only a specific date: `node scripts/sync-updates-from-tools.js 2026-02-13`

If you forget to run `release:additions` (or `update:sync`), new tools will still show in Explore and Collections, but they won’t appear in the Updates changelog until you run it.

## Deployment

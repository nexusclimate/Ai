## What it does
data.gov.uk is the UK government’s open data portal, publishing structured datasets on climate, energy, emissions, environment, and policy. It provides a searchable catalog and often APIs or downloads, so you can build data-aware Climate GPTs or tools that pull from official UK data instead of purely generative answers.

## Who it's for
Researchers, policymakers, and developers working on UK climate, energy, or policy—or building tools that need structured UK datasets.

## How to use it
Visit [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk), search by topic (e.g. climate, energy, emissions), and use the catalog to find and access datasets. Where available, use API or bulk download to feed data into your GPT or application for sector emissions, grid intensity, policy scanning, or opportunity mapping.

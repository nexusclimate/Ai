## What it does
Llama is Meta's family of open large language models (open weights, various sizes). You can download, fine-tune, and host them on your own infrastructure or via partners. That allows fine-tuning on climate data, building vertical climate agents, or creating reusable GPT-style modules without being locked into a single API long term.

## Who it's for
Developers and teams building climate or sustainability AI who want open model weights, control over fine-tuning and deployment, and flexibility to run on-prem or in their own cloud.

## How to use it
Use [Meta Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama) for model access, documentation, and license terms. Combine with Hugging Face or other tooling for fine-tuning and deployment. Fine-tune on climate datasets, wrap in APIs or chat UIs, and build agents or disclosure tools that run on your stack.

## What it does
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides a widely adopted framework for reporting climate-related risks and opportunities under four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Its structure is machine-referenceable and has influenced ISSB and other standards. You can build disclosure drafting assistants or ESG compliance GPTs that align with TCFD (or ISSB) and map disclosures to this structure.

## Who it's for
Corporates, investors, and advisors preparing climate-related financial disclosures—and developers building tools for disclosure drafting, compliance checking, or taxonomy mapping.

## How to use it
Use [FSB TCFD](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org) for the official recommendations, guidance, and implementation resources. Use the four-pillar structure to power GPTs or apps that draft or validate governance, strategy, risk, and metrics sections. Combine with IFRS S2 or EU standards where required. Highly reusable across startups, corporates, and investors.

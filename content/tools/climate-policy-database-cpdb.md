## What it does
The Climate Policy Database (CPDB) is a collaborative policy implementation dataset by NewClimate Institute, tracking climate mitigation policies globally. It provides a structured database of climate policy instruments and their status, with download or API availability for many datasets. Coverage spans many countries and is well suited to comparative policy analysis.

## Who it's for
Researchers, policymakers, analysts, and developers who need richly structured policy metadata for summaries, dashboards, or AI-assisted analysis and briefing tools.

## What it does
Mistral AI releases open and efficient large language models (e.g. Mistral, Mixtral) that you can download, fine-tune, and host yourself. Use them to fine-tune on climate data, build vertical climate agents, or create reusable GPT-style modules without depending solely on external APIs long term.

## Who it's for
Developers and startups building climate or sustainability AI who want strong open models, efficiency, and control over fine-tuning and deployment.

## How to use it
Use [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai) for model access, docs, and APIs. For open weights, use the published checkpoints with Hugging Face or your own stack. Fine-tune on climate datasets, deploy for inference, and build agents or tools (e.g. disclosure drafting, compliance checking) on your infrastructure.

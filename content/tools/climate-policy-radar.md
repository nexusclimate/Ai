## What it does
Climate Policy Radar provides a live, global, searchable database of climate laws, policies, and official submissions. It indexes 30,000+ climate policy documents—national laws, strategies, targets, and more—and uses AI and ML in the open to organise and make policy texts accessible. The project is open-source with repos on GitHub (front-end, back-end, knowledge-graph, SDK).

## Who it's for
Researchers, policymakers, compliance and sustainability teams, and developers building AI briefing or analysis tools that need to fetch, summarise, and compare climate policy across countries and themes.

## How to use it
Use [Climate Policy Radar](https://www.climatepolicyradar.org) to search and explore policy documents. For integration or custom tools, see the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/climatepolicyradar). Combine with your own GPT or app to build briefing systems that pull from structured policy data.

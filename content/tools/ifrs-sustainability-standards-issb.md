## What it does
The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), under the IFRS Foundation, issues global sustainability disclosure standards (e.g. IFRS S1 on general sustainability-related disclosures, IFRS S2 on climate). These standards are machine-readable and widely adopted, so you can build ESG compliance GPTs, taxonomy mapping tools, or disclosure drafting assistants that align with a single global baseline.

## Who it's for
Startups, corporates, investors, and advisors who need to align disclosures with IFRS Sustainability Standards—and developers building ESG or climate reporting tools.

## How to use it
Use [IFRS ISSB](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-sustainability-standards-board) for the official standards, guidance, and supporting materials. Combine with XBRL taxonomies where available to build GPTs or tools that map activities to disclosure requirements, draft disclosures, or check compliance. Reusable across jurisdictions that adopt or align with ISSB.

## What it does
NASA Earthdata Search is NASA’s primary open-data portal for global Earth observation satellite imagery and derived science products. It provides full open access to data from MODIS, Landsat, and many other missions, with global coverage and historical archives. The portal offers search tools and API support for programmatic access, so you can discover, visualize, and download data for climate analysis, land cover change detection, and environmental modeling.

## Who it's for
Researchers, analysts, and developers working on climate and environmental applications that need authoritative satellite-derived datasets—especially for time-series studies, land use change, and Earth system science.

## How to use it
Go to [Earthdata Search](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov) to search by mission, product, location, or time range. Use the search and filter tools to find datasets; many support direct download or API access. Combine with your own analysis pipelines or tools for climate and land-cover applications.

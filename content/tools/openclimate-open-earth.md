## What it does
OpenClimate is an open-data utility from the Open-Earth Foundation with a database of emissions data, reduction targets, climate plans, and actions. It offers API support and is Apache-2.0 licensed, so it is reusable and integrable. It covers CO₂ emissions, reduction targets, and climate action at multiple scales, giving useful climate context around policies (e.g. emissions vs targets).

## Who it's for
Developers, researchers, and analysts building tools or GPTs that need structured emissions and policy-context data—especially for comparing emissions to targets and for integrated briefings.

## How to use it
Use the [OpenClimate repository](https://github.com/Open-Earth-Foundation/OpenClimate) for documentation, data access, and API integration. Feed emissions and target data into your own analysis or briefing modules.

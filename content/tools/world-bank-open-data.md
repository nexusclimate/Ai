## What it does
World Bank Open Data (data.worldbank.org) is a global open data portal with structured datasets on development, climate, energy, and environment. It offers country and indicator-level data that you can search, visualize, and often access via API—suitable for building data-aware Climate GPTs with global coverage.

## Who it's for
Researchers, policymakers, and developers who need global or cross-country climate, energy, or development data for analysis, tools, or AI-assisted workflows.

## How to use it
Go to [data.worldbank.org](https://data.worldbank.org), browse by topic (e.g. climate change, energy) or country, and use the catalog and tools to explore or download data. Use the API or bulk downloads to feed World Bank data into your GPT or app for sector emissions, grid intensity, policy context, or opportunity mapping.

## What it does
ClimateGPT is an open-source ensemble of large language models focused on climate change, from Erasmus.AI with AppTek and EQTY Lab. It includes 7B, 13B, and 70B parameter models trained on 300B+ climate-specific tokens from scientific papers, UN and World Bank reports, IPCC and NASA data, and more. Models support 20+ languages and were trained on renewable energy. Released on Hugging Face in January 2024; widely used in research.

## Who it's for
Researchers, policymakers, and organizations that need climate-literate AI for synthesis, analysis, and multilingual support.

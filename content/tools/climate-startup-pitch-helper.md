## What it does
Manus AI Pitch Deck Generator builds investor-ready pitch decks in minutes. You describe your startup, product, and target audience and can share existing materials (business plans, financial data, market analysis). The tool researches your market, crafts the narrative, and designs professional slides—useful for climate and impact founders who need to communicate traction and impact clearly.

## Who it's for
Climate and impact founders preparing for seed or Series A who want a fast way to turn their story and data into a polished pitch deck without starting from a blank slide deck.

## How to use it
Open [Manus AI Pitch Deck Generator](https://manus.im/playbook/pitch-deck-generator), describe your startup and audience, and optionally upload or paste business plans, financials, or market notes. The more context you give, the better the deck. Use the output as a draft to refine with your team and stress-test with advisors before investor meetings.

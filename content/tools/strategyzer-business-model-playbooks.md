## What it does
Strategyzer’s [Playbook Library](https://www.strategyzer.com/program-library) gives you step-by-step guided playbooks for business model design, innovation, and strategy—backed by their Business Model Canvas and Value Proposition methods. Playbooks include **Competing on Business Models**, **Aligning sales, marketing & product**, **How to evaluate innovation projects: invest or kill**, **Idea generation for customer-centric growth**, **Craft & communicate your innovation strategy**, and **Strong value propositions and differentiation with Gen-AI** (the AI Companion–style playbook). You get structured workflows, visual canvases, and an AI-powered platform so teams can run strategic workshops and turn insights into concrete actions.

## Who it's for
Founders, innovation and strategy leads, and cross-functional teams who want to use the Business Model Canvas and related tools in a guided, repeatable way—and who are interested in Gen-AI–assisted value proposition and differentiation work.

## How to use it
Go to [Strategyzer Program Library](https://www.strategyzer.com/program-library), choose a playbook (e.g. business models, innovation, or the Gen-AI value proposition playbook), and run it in their platform. Individual access includes the full playbook library; team and enterprise options add collaboration and facilitation. Use the AI-backed playbook for value propositions and differentiation; use the others for business model and strategy alignment.

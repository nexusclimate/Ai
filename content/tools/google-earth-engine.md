## What it does
Google Earth Engine combines a large catalog of satellite imagery (including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and many other datasets) with cloud computing so you can run analysis at scale without downloading raw data. It is free for research and non-commercial use. Use it for land cover mapping, vegetation indices, time-series analysis, and global or regional environmental monitoring.

## Who it's for
Researchers, NGOs, and analysts who need to process large amounts of Earth observation data for climate, land use, or environmental applications—especially where local compute or data transfer would be a bottleneck.

## How to use it
Sign up at [Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) and use the Code Editor (JavaScript) or the Python API (e.g. with geemap) to query the catalog, build composites, and run analyses in the cloud. Combine with NASA Earthdata or Copernicus data when you need mission-specific products not yet in the catalog.

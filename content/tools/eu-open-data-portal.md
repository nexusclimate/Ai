## What it does
The EU Open Data Portal (data.europa.eu) is the European Union’s open data infrastructure. It publishes structured datasets on energy, emissions, environment, and policy from EU institutions and member states. You can search, filter, and often access data via API or download—suitable for building data-aware Climate GPTs that cite structured EU data.

## Who it's for
Researchers, policymakers, developers, and analysts who need EU-level climate, energy, or policy data for reports, tools, or AI-assisted workflows.

## How to use it
Go to [data.europa.eu](https://data.europa.eu), search by theme (e.g. environment, energy) or keyword, and use the catalog to find datasets. Many datasets offer API or bulk download. Use these feeds in your own tools or GPTs for sector emissions lookup, grid intensity, policy scanning, or opportunity mapping.

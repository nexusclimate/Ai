## What it does
Google’s Flood Hub uses ML to predict extreme floods up to 7 days in advance, including in ungauged watersheds. It extends reliable lead times and expands coverage to 100+ countries. The platform offers free real-time flood forecasts and, for researchers, API access and the GRRR (Google Runoff Reanalysis & Reforecast) dataset.

## Who it's for
Emergency managers, NGOs, governments, and researchers working on flood preparedness and climate resilience, especially where traditional gauges are limited.

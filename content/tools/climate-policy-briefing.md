## What it does
The Climate Policy Briefing Assistant creates quick briefings and implications summaries from climate policy documents and updates. It helps you scan new regulations, directives, and guidance (e.g. CSRD, CBAM, IPCC-related policy) and turn them into digestible summaries with clear implications for your organisation. Use it to stay on top of regulatory developments without reading every source in full.

## Who it's for
Sustainability and compliance teams, policy leads, and executives who need to keep leadership informed on climate regulation. Also useful for consultants and advisors preparing client briefings on policy changes.

## How to use it
Open the tool at [nexusclimate.ai](https://nexusclimate.ai/tools/climate-policy-briefing-assistant), paste or upload policy text (or describe the policy you care about), and request a briefing or implications summary. Always cross-check critical points with official sources before making decisions.

## What it does
Taiga is an open-source project management platform focused on Agile workflows. It supports Scrum and Kanban, so you can plan sprints, track stories and tasks, and manage delivery. It works well with small teams and offers a free self-hostable option (AGPL-licensed). Use it for product development, software startups, and agile planning without depending on proprietary tools.

## Who it's for
Product and engineering leads, software startups, and small teams who want an open-source way to run Scrum or Kanban, plan and track features, and deliver in an agile way — with the option to self-host or use the cloud offering.

## How to use it
Go to [Taiga](https://taiga.io) to try the cloud version or download for self-hosting. Create projects, configure boards (Kanban/Scrum), add user stories and tasks, and track progress. Integrate with your repo or other tools as needed via the available integrations.

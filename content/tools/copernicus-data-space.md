## What it does
The Copernicus Data Space provides the European Space Agency’s Copernicus open satellite data ecosystem, with free access to high-resolution Earth observation imagery from Sentinel missions—including Sentinel-1 (radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical). It offers frequent global revisit (every few days), multiple sensor types, and free download of analysis-ready data. Use it for vegetation monitoring, land use change, urban growth, and water mapping.

## Who it's for
Researchers, environmental and agricultural analysts, and developers building applications that need free, frequent, and high-resolution satellite imagery—especially for land cover, vegetation, and water monitoring.

## How to use it
Use [Copernicus Data Space](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/open-access) to discover and download Sentinel data. Search by area, time, and product; access is free after registration. Integrate with your own analysis or combine with other Earth observation tools (e.g. Google Earth Engine) for processing at scale.

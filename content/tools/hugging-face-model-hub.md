## What it does
Hugging Face provides a central hub for open-source models, datasets, and pipelines—including large language models (LLMs). You can discover, download, fine-tune, and host models and demos (e.g. via Spaces). That makes it possible to fine-tune open models on climate data, build vertical climate agents, or create reusable GPT-style modules instead of relying only on third-party APIs.

## Who it's for
Developers, researchers, and startups building climate or sustainability AI—who want to own their stack, reduce API dependency, or tailor models to climate use cases.

## How to use it
Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), browse the Model Hub for base LLMs and climate-related datasets or models. Use the Transformers and related libraries to fine-tune or run inference. Deploy demos with Spaces. Use this stack to build climate-specific agents, disclosure assistants, or data-aware tools that run on your chosen infrastructure.

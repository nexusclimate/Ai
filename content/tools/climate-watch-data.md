## What it does
Climate Watch provides open-data emissions and policy datasets for climate action metrics. It includes historical emissions, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), net-zero targets, long-term strategies, and related policy data. The Data Explorer supports filtering and bulk download. Data is open and suitable for integration into analysis and briefing tools.

## Who it's for
Analysts, researchers, and developers who need emissions and policy datasets in open formats for dashboards, models, or AI-assisted briefings and action tracking.

## How to use it
Use [Climate Watch](https://www.climatewatchdata.org) and the [Data Explorer](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/data-explorer/historical-emissions) to filter and download datasets. Integrate the data into your own tools or GPTs for emissions and policy analysis.

short_summary: "Open-source data portal software used by governments and institutions to publish structured datasets (energy, emissions, policy). Build data-aware climate GPTs on top."
last_verified: "2026-02-11"
use_cases:
  - "Discover and query structured climate datasets via API for sector emissions, grid intensity, policy data"
  - "Build a Climate GPT that pulls from CKAN-based portals instead of purely generative answers"
  - "Sector emissions lookup, grid carbon intensity by country, policy and subsidy scanning"
  - "Climate opportunity mapping using published open data"
limitations:
  - "Data quality and coverage depend on each portal; not all portals use CKAN"
  - "Integration with GPTs requires API or export workflows"

## What it does
CKAN is open-source software for building and running open data portals. Many governments and climate institutions use it to publish structured datasets on energy, emissions, policy, and infrastructure. Portals built with CKAN expose data via APIs and catalogs, so you can build data-aware Climate GPTs that pull from real datasets instead of relying only on generative answers.

## Who it's for
Developers, researchers, and teams building climate or sustainability tools that need structured data sources—and anyone exploring open climate data infrastructures.

## How to use it
Use [CKAN](https://ckan.org) to run your own data portal or to understand how many public portals work. To consume data, use CKAN-based portals such as [EU Open Data](https://data.europa.eu), [UK Open Data](https://data.gov.uk), or [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org)—each has search, filters, and often APIs for programmatic access. Combine with a GPT or app that queries these sources for sector emissions, grid intensity, or policy scans.

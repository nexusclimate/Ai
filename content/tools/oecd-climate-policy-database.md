## What it does
The OECD provides structured climate policy datasets, including a taxonomy of mitigation policy instruments. Data is available in downloadable formats (e.g. CSV, XLS) and supports analysis of policy instrument types and coverage across countries. It is not a full application but a dataset you can integrate into your own tools.

## Who it's for
Researchers, analysts, and developers who need internationally comparable, structured policy data for dashboards, models, or AI-assisted analysis.

## How to use it
Access the [OECD PINE database](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/policy-instruments-for-the-environment-pine-database.html) and related climate policy data from the OECD. Download in open formats and integrate into your analysis or briefing modules.

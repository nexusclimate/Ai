## What it does
XBRL is an open, global standard for machine-readable business and sustainability reporting. Taxonomies define tags for financial and ESG concepts so disclosures can be structured, comparable, and processable. Many regulators and standards (e.g. IFRS, EU) use or align with XBRL/ESEF, so you can build ESG compliance GPTs, taxonomy mapping tools, or disclosure drafting assistants that work with structured reporting.

## Who it's for
Developers, reporting teams, and advisors who need to produce or consume digital sustainability reports—and anyone building tools that rely on machine-readable ESG or climate disclosures.

## How to use it
Use [XBRL International](https://www.xbrl.org) for the standard, specifications, and taxonomy links. Combine with IFRS Sustainability Standards, EU Taxonomy, or local XBRL/ESEF taxonomies to build GPTs or apps that map activities to tags, draft disclosures, or validate structure. Highly reusable across startups, corporates, and investors where digital reporting is required.

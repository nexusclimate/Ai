## What it does
This GPT assists with shifting from linear to circular business models. You can use it to explore product design, reverse logistics, refurbishment, and material recovery strategies—as an AI tool, not a consultancy or service.

## Who it's for
Product designers, sustainability managers, and entrepreneurs who want a GPT to brainstorm and structure circular economy ideas.

## Sources
The GPT draws on Ellen MacArthur Foundation frameworks and business model patterns (e.g. Patagonia Worn Wear, Interface ReEntry). For deeper reading, see [Ellen MacArthur Foundation](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/).

## What it does
Quickscan Circular Business Models (CBM) is an interactive tool that first helps you see where you stand on sustainable and circular entrepreneurship (priority, experience, ambition, current business model) via a questionnaire and spider plot. In a second phase you explore options for a new or adjusted circular business model: basic type, R-strategies, organisational form, supporting processes, and revenue model—with concrete examples to inspire choices.

## Who it's for
Circular entrepreneurs, product and sustainability managers, and teams who want a structured way to assess their current position and explore circular business model options without jumping straight to a single design.

## How to use it
Open [Quickscan Circular Business Models](https://businessmodellab.nl/en/tools/quickscan-circulair-businessmodel). Download the Excel tool or use the PDF for offline use. Complete phase 1 (questionnaire; ideally with several colleagues and a short discussion), then use phase 2 to explore model characteristics and examples. For further elaboration, the platform recommends their Business Model Template and Circular Organisation tools.

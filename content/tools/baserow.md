## What it does
Baserow is a self-hostable, open-source alternative to Airtable — a no-code database you can use to structure data and build lightweight internal apps. You can create CRM-style lists, customer databases, project trackers, and similar tools without writing code. It’s well suited to startups and small teams who need to organize data and ship internal tools or MVPs quickly, with the option to self-host for control and cost.

## Who it's for
Startups, small teams, and operators who want to structure data and build simple internal apps (CRM, project tracking, customer lists) without developer overhead — and who are open to self-hosting or using a managed offering.

## How to use it
Go to [Baserow](https://baserow.io) to sign up for the cloud offering or download and self-host. Create bases and views, link tables, and optionally use AI-assisted features where available. Use it for MVPs, internal tools, and organizing structured data before scaling to custom code if needed.

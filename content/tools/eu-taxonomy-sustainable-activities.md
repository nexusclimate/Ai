## What it does
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines which economic activities count as environmentally sustainable for EU regulation and sustainable finance. It provides technical screening criteria and is used for disclosure under NFRD/CSRD. The structure and criteria are referenceable for building taxonomy mapping GPTs, disclosure drafting assistants, or ESG compliance tools that need EU alignment.

## Who it's for
Corporates, investors, and advisors in or serving the EU market—and developers building tools for sustainable finance, CSRD reporting, or activity screening.

## How to use it
Use the [EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance/tools-and-standards/eu-taxonomy-sustainable-activities_en) page for official text, delegated acts, and guidance. Combine with XBRL/ESEF where relevant for digital reporting. Use the criteria to power GPTs or apps that map activities to taxonomy, draft disclosures, or support compliance checks. Highly reusable across EU-covered entities.

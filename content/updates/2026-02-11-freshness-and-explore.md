- **Explore** — Search and filter all tools by platform, collection, maturity, verified, and tags. Sort by updated, featured, verified, or name.
- **Changelog** — The [Updates](/updates) page lists what’s new. To add an entry, create a markdown file in `content/updates/` (e.g. `2026-02-15-release.md`) with frontmatter: `date`, `title`, and optional `summary`; the body is the update text.
- **Recently updated** — Home page now shows tools sorted by last verified date.
- **Last refreshed** — The index shows when the site was last built so the hub feels up to date.

summary: "Seven new additions: Climate Policy Radar, CPDB, Climate Change Laws of the World, OpenClimate, OpenEI, OECD Climate Policy Database, and Climate Watch Data."

Latest new additions to the hub — all with proper external sources:

- **Climate Policy Radar** — [climatepolicyradar.org](https://www.climatepolicyradar.org) · [GitHub](https://github.com/climatepolicyradar). Live, global, searchable database of 30,000+ climate laws, policies, and official submissions. Open code and open data; AI & ML in the open. Basis for AI briefing systems that fetch, summarise and compare policy documents.

- **Climate Policy Database (CPDB)** — [climatepolicydatabase.org](https://climatepolicydatabase.org). By NewClimate Institute. Collaborative policy implementation dataset tracking climate mitigation policies globally. Structured database of policy instruments and status; useful for comparative policy analysis and feeding into summaries and analysis modules.

- **Climate Change Laws of the World** — [climate-laws.org](https://climate-laws.org). Searchable database of climate laws and policy texts from 196+ countries. Legal context for policy briefings and regulatory/compliance summaries.

- **OpenClimate (Open-Earth Foundation)** — [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Earth-Foundation/OpenClimate). Open data utility: emissions data, targets, climate plans, and actions with API support. Apache-2.0 licensed. Gives climate context around policies (e.g. emissions vs targets).

- **Open Energy Information (OpenEI)** — [en.openei.org](https://en.openei.org). Open government-backed semantic wiki for energy and policy data; regulatory and incentive information. Public domain, searchable via APIs. Links energy policy with climate targets for integrated briefings.

- **OECD Climate Policy Database** — OECD policy instruments (PINE) and related datasets. Taxonomy of mitigation policy instruments in CSV/XLS and open formats for integration into analysis and tools.

- **Climate Watch Data** — [climatewatchdata.org](https://www.climatewatchdata.org). Open emissions and policy datasets: historical emissions, NDCs, net-zero targets, long-term strategies. Data Explorer for filtering and download; useful for action metrics and briefings.

All of these are now in the [Explore](/explore) and [Collections](/collections) pages. We also removed the previous Climate Policy Briefing Assistant entry (no standalone external source) and replaced it with these underlying sources.
